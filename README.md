A. TABLE OF CONTENT
Task 0
Solution to write a function that produces output according to a format.

Task 1
Solution to handle the following conversion specifiers:
d
i

Task 2
Solution to handle the following custom conversion specifiers:
b: the unsigned int argument is converted to binary

Task 3
Solution to handle the following conversion specifiers:
u
o
x
X

Task 4
Solution to use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible.

Task 5
Solution to handle the following custom conversion specifier:
S : prints the string.
Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters)

Task 6
Solution to handle the following conversion specifier: p.

Task 7
Solution to handle the following flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers:
+
space
#

Task 8
Solution to gandle the following length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers:
l
h
Conversion specifiers to handle: d, i, u, o, x, X

Task 9
Solution to handle the field width for non-custom convharacter for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Task 12
Solution to handle the - flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Task 13
Solution to handle the following custom conversion specifier:
r : prints the reversed string

Task 14
Solution to handle the following custom conversion specifier:
R: prints the rot13'ed string

Task 15
Solution to ensure all the above options work well together.

B.ABOUT THE  FUNCTIONS
Authorized functions and macros

write (man 2 write)

malloc (man 3 malloc)

free (man 3 free)

va_start (man 3 va_start)

va_end (man 3 va_end)

va_copy (man 3 va_copy)

va_arg (man 3 va_arg)

C.HOW IT WORKS
The _printf() function is a function that imitatates the actual "print() command loated in te stdio.h of C programming Language. It is a c function used to output results to the standard input and output (stdio). The function is variadic by nature which means it can take a varied number of arguments.

D. THE PROJECT FORMATE IDENTIFIES THE FOLLOWING:
* That this is Alx -printf paired project with contributions from teammates
* No global variables used
*No more than 5 functions per file
*The prototypes of all functions are included in  header file called main.h
*Header file was pushed
*Header files was included and guarded.
